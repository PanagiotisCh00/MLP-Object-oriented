#MLP-Object-oriented

This is a repository for some machine learning projects i did in CS 442: Machine Learning course in university of Cyprus. 
In the first project (MLP.py) i created a Multilayer Perceptron in python that calculates the XOR function. I used object-oriented design to create its architecture and
learning algorithm
